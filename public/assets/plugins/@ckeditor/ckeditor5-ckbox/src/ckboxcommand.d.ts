 * The CKBox command. It is used by the {@link module:ckbox/ckboxediting~CKBoxEditing CKBox editing feature} to open the CKBox file manager.
 * The file manager allows inserting an image or a link to a file into the editor content.
 *
 * ```ts
 * editor.execute( 'ckbox' );
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** This command uses other features to perform the following tasks:
 * - To insert images it uses the {@link module:image/image/insertimagecommand~InsertImageCommand 'insertImage'} command from the
 * {@link module:image/image~Image Image feature}.
 * - To insert links to other files it uses the {@link module:link/linkcommand~LinkCommand 'link'} command from the
 * {@link module:link/link~Link Link feature}.

     * A set of all chosen assets. They are stored temporarily and they are automatically removed 1 second after being chosen.

     * This association map is then used to set the ID on the model element.
     *
     * All chosen assets are automatically removed after the timeout, because (theoretically) it may happen that they will never be
     * inserted into the model, even if the {@link module:link/linkcommand~LinkCommand `'link'`} command or the
     * {@link module:image/image/insertimagecommand~InsertImageCommand `'insertImage'`} command is enabled. Such a case may arise when
     * another plugin blocks the command execution. Then, in order not to keep the chosen (but not inserted) assets forever, we delete
     * them automatically to prevent memory leakage. The 1 second timeout is enough to insert the asset into the model and extract the
     * ID from the chosen asset.
     *
     * The assets are stored only if
     * the {@link module:ckbox/ckboxconfig~CKBoxConfig#ignoreDataId `config.ckbox.ignoreDataId`} option is set to `false` (by default).
